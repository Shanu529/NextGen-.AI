1. ❌ FormData not working
   Problem: You wrote FormData, but didn’t create an actual form.

Why it failed: The API needs the data in a special form (like when you upload files).

Fix: You had to write:

js
Copy code
const form = new FormData();
form.append("prompt", prompt); 2. ❌ You passed the wrong thing to axios
Problem: You sent FormData class itself instead of the form you created.

Fix: Replace this:

js
Copy code
axios.post(url, FormData, ...)
with this:

js
Copy code
axios.post(url, form, {
headers: {
...form.getHeaders(),
'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'
}
}); 3. ❌ responseType issue
Problem: You forgot to use quotes.

Fix: This:

js
Copy code
responseType: arraybuffer // ❌ wrong
should be:

js
Copy code
responseType: "arraybuffer" // ✅ correct 4. ❌ No image was returned
Problem: You were generating the image, but didn’t send it back in the response.

Fix: Just include the image like this:

js
Copy code
res.json({
success: true,
message: "Image generated",
image: resultImage
}); 5. ❌ Auth issue (userId missing)
Problem: Sometimes your request didn’t include the user ID because the middleware wasn’t attaching it properly.

Fix: In your auth middleware:

js
Copy code
req.userId = tokenDecoder.id;
Now the controller can use req.userId to find the user in the database.
